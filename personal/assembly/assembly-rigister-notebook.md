AX is the most commonly used register. It is used for arithmetic operations. It is also used to store return values of functions. It is also used to store the result of multiplication and division operations.
### BX
BX is used as a base register. It is used to store the base address of the data segment (DS).
### RBX
RBX is used as a base register. It is used to store the base address of the data segment (DS).
### CX
CX is used as a counter register. It is used to store the count for string and loop operations.
### DX
DX is used as a data register. It is used to store the I/O port number for I/O operations.

## Segment Registers
### CS
CS is the code segment register. It is used to store the base address of the code segment (CS).
### DS
DS is the data segment register. It is used to store the base address of the data segment (DS).
### SS
SS is the stack segment register. It is used to store the base address of the stack segment (SS).
### ES
ES is the extra segment register. It is used to store the base address of the extra segment (ES).
## Index Registers
### SI
SI is the source index register. It is used as the source index for string operations.
### DI
DI is the destination index register. It is used as the destination index for string operations.

## Pointer Registers
### SP
SP is the stack pointer register. It is used to store the top address of the stack.
### BP
BP is the base pointer register. It is used to store the base address of the stack.
### IP
IP is the instruction pointer register. It is used to store the offset address of the next instruction to be executed.
## Flag Register
### FLAGS
FLAGS is the flag register. It is used to store the status of the processor. It is also used to check the result of the previous arithmetic operation.
